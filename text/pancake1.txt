snow oreo was lonely.
one night meatball had a dream.
hella sandwich had turned into a cat.
cat hella sandwich was walking through streets at night.
meatball followed her to a secret cat room.
they were plotting to kill snow oreo.
when meatball woke up he tried to tell snow oreo to be careful.
but hella sandwich was gone.
and she never came back.
snow oreo was sad.
meatball tried to explain that it was better.
hella sandwich was really bad.
but snow oreo couldnâ€™t understand.
he kept meatball anyway.
they became the best friends.
but sometimes snow oreo would look at meatball.
with a sadness in his eyes.
and meatball knew he was thinking of hella sandwich.
so one day.
meatball snuck outside at night.
and found a little kitten who belonged to another human.
meatball kidnapped the kitten.
and when the girl put up signs looking for him,
snow oreo responded.
the girl came to our house.
and when she saw the kitten,
she had a big smile on her face.
and she yelled, its pancake!
